It is a plant-based substance found in bearberry, cranberries, blueberries, wheat, and pears. Alpha Arbutin is more stable and effective than its beta form. Arbutin helps stop the molecules that stimulate pigmentation and melanin in your body without killing them completely, and has a milder effect compared to hydroquinone, which is prescription strength. This makes arbutin a safe and effective choice for people with sensitive skin and uneven skin tone.","sourceUrl":"https://skincity.com/en/skin-guide/tips-advice/arbutin-treating-uneven-skin-tone","__v":0}
